# STORY.FUND

## A good story is worth a thousand charts

--------
As planners, strategists and consultants, we live off presentation slides. For every craftsman, his tools are an important asset. And stories have a big and special role in our toolbox. Fortunately stories, when shared, donâ€™t dilute, but instead they grow and get better. [Story.fund](http://story.fund) is an attempt at collecting short stories that carry some meaning, potentially applicable in our professional lives.

I hope that more members of the thinking and planning community will join in, sharing their stories and growing our toolboxes together. Because sometimes a good story is worth a thousand charts, and sharing it in an easily presentable form (all pictures 16:9, ready for your powerpoints) can make a big difference.

[Story.fund](http://story.fund) website is built on top of Tumblr (custom theme), which is a perfect content hosting and distribution platform for such a project.
