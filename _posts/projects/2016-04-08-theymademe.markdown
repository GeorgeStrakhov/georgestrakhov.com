## Standing on the shoulders of Giants

We are all [standing on the shoulders of Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants): those who help us see further. But in our busy lives we don't often get a chance to communicate with those giants, to get inspired by them again and again.
[TheyMade.Me](http://theymade.me) is meant to change this.

You can think of it as of a mix between Wikipedia and Facebook. Here you get to choose your Giants and to follow them like you follow your friends on Facebook. You will receive bitesize updates from your Giants and they will continue to inspire you regularly.
